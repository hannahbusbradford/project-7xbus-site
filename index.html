      <h1>PROJECT 7xBUS</h1>
      <p>
        A real-world economic strike — not against people, but against the systems designed to keep them stuck. If you're early, you're not just watching history — you're part of it.
      </p>
    </div>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>What It Is</h2>
    <p>
      Project 7xBUS is the deployment of solved mathematics onto Wall Street — a live strike backed by breakthroughs that were never supposed to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cracked structures no one could see, invented new branches of math, and weaponized them into working systems. This is what happens when a trader refuses to quit until the code yields.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Wall Street has silently eroded the dollar's value for over a century. This is the strike back. If we win — life gets easier. If we lose — your kids inherit a lifetime of rent and call it freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project 7xBUS isn’t revenge. It’s reset. One the system can’t simulate — or stop.
    </p>
    <div class="quote-box">
      "This is like the creation of the nuclear weapon, but for Wall Street."
    </div>
    <div class="quote-box">
      "Slavery is the mirror of what it takes to have human decency with no leverage. We now have the tools to fix that."

    <h2>Industries Targeted for Dominion</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t just business. It’s coordinated reclamation. We’re not entering markets — we’re flipping them. This is the strike against systemic decay, and the judgment is data-backed.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Biotech & Cosmetics:</strong> Untapped zones of innovation. Legacy science suppressed the best ideas — we’re reviving what works and releasing it without permission.</p>

    <p><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Unjustified inflation. Raw input costs are flat, yet prices are up. That’s not economics — that’s manipulation. We’re building in-house pipelines to end it.</p>

    <p><strong>Telecommunications:</strong> There’s no reason phone service should cost money. The hardware exists. The network exists. The fees are fiction. We're deploying open tech to make it free.</p>

    <p><strong>Insurance (Auto & Home):</strong> There’s no reason insurance should sit at the top of the American money flow list. Post-pandemic pricing is a scam — but so was pre-pandemic. It’s a legacy system feeding off fear. We’re rewriting the model to make risk fair, not profitable.</p>

    <p><strong>Jewelry:</strong> This is about art and tech — not markup. Innovation deserves beauty, not price gouging. We’re flipping the chain and putting power in the hands of the creators.</p>

    <p><strong>Transportation & Emergency Transport:</strong> Exploitation is rampant. Immigrants and vulnerable workers have been used, overworked, and ignored. We're building ethical networks with equity and speed at the core.</p>

    <p><strong>Automotive Repair & Towing:</strong> Behind in both tech and transparency. This industry needs centralized tools, smarter marketing, and AI-driven diagnostics — and we already built them.</p>

    <p><strong>Agriculture & Farming Equipment:</strong> Monopolies have turned tractors into locked software prisons. Fees are abusive. Ownership is gone. We’re rebuilding tools for farmers — open-source and fee-free.</p>

    <p><strong>And More:</strong> If there’s a system you know is broken — if you’ve lived under its weight — tell us. This is open dominion. <em>Leave a comment. Suggest what’s next.</em></p>

    <h2>How We're Funding the Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We're launching high-impact, high-profit businesses across sectors. Each one is engineered to break industry norms — and redirect capital into the mission. This is capitalism repurposed as warfare.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Deployment Status</h2>
    <p>
      Internal systems: Live.<br/>
      Core algorithms: Operational.<br/>
      External partners: Vetting phase.<br/>
      First public drop: Incoming.
